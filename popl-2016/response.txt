Thanks to all the reviewers for the time they put into the paper. We
especially appreciate the explicit and implicit comments on the
presentation. They will help us improve it and we expect to use them
to the benefit of the work.

Review 138A:

Traces are what we use to define what the equilibrium points, namely
the values of "M" in the definition at the bottom of page 7. The
omission of a more explicit connection between fairness and f-fairness
was an oversight and has been corrected in our version of the paper.

The reviewer asks why contracts are needed. We use them because they
can express dependent types. For example, the contracts express that
the arguments to map/e form a bijection. Given that this is a
practical, deployed system, we don't have the advantage of using
dependent types directly like we do in the Coq model.

Review 138B:

The reviewer suggests that accounting only for the size of enumerated
structures is sufficient. But this would ignore fairness, because
there our fair pairing combinator and the commonly used unfair pairing
combinator have the same memory use. Our empirical evaluation proves
that distinguishing them is essential.

We did not find any fundamental flaws in our reasoning via Coq, but we
did find that the exercise of implementing the semantics (in Redex and
in Coq) clarified the concepts. We credit that clarity with helping us
to come up with the idea of using traces.

Yes, poor choice of benchmark programs can skew results. Our
benchmark, however, has been very carefully designed. It was one of
the products of one of the author's PhD thesis and you can find more
explanation of it here: http://docs.racket-lang.org/redex/benchmark.html

Review 138C:

Your proposed definition of fairness does seem interesting from a
purely theoretical point of view and we agree that there exist
combinators that are fair according to your definition but not fair
according to ours. In practice, however, we are not aware of any
actually used combinators that are fair according to yours but not our
definition and we doubt that one such would perform better
empirically.

Stepping back, this paper is the first one on fair enumeration
combinators and we give (in our opinion) a convincing theoretical
justification and a convincing empirical justification for our
definitions. There may be better ones and once the community has had
time to absorb ours, perhaps we will find those other definitions. We
see this paper as a first step, not the final word.
