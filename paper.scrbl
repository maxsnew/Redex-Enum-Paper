@abstract{
  This paper reports on the design of combinators
  for building efficient bijections between the 
  naturals numbers (or a prefix of them) and algebraic
  datatypes constructed by sums, recursion, and (possibly
  dependent) pairs.
  
  Our enumeration combinators support a new property
  we call fairness. Intuitively the result of fair combinator 
  indexes into its argument combinators equally when constructing
  its result. For example, extracting the
  @raw-latex{$n$}th element from our enumeration of three-tuples
  indexes about @raw-latex{$\sqrt[3]{n}$} elements into each
  of its components instead of, say, indexing @raw-latex{$\sqrt[2]{n}$}
  into one and @raw-latex{$\sqrt[4]{n}$} into the other two as you would 
  if you build a three-tuple out of nested pairs. The paper
  develops the theory of fairness and contains proofs establishing
  fairness of our combinators and a proof that some combinations of 
  fair combinators are not fair.
  
  The design of our combinators is driven by our primary
  application, property-based testing in Redex. The paper also
  reports on how our combinators can support enumeration for arbitrary
  Redex models and an empirical comparison between enumeration-based 
  property generation and ad hoc random generation, showing
  that the strategies are complementary.
