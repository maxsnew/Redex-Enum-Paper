@title[#:tag "sec:fair"]{Combinator Fairness}

A fair enumeration combinator is one that indexes into its
given enumerators roughly equally, instead of indexing
deeply into one and shallowly into a different one. For
example, imagine we waned to build an enumerator for lists
of length 4. This enumerator is one way to build it:
@racketblock[(cons/e
              nat/e
              (cons/e
               nat/e
               (cons/e
                nat/e
                (cons/e
                 nat/e
                 (fin/e null)))))]
Unfortunately, it is not fair. This is the 1,000,000,000th element,
@code{@(format "~v"
             (decode (cons/e
                      nat/e
                      (cons/e
                       nat/e
                       (cons/e
                        nat/e
                        (cons/e
                         nat/e
                         (fin/e null)))))
                     1000000000))}
and, as you can see, it has indexed far more deeply into the first
@racket[nat/e] than the others. In contrast, if we balance the @racket[cons/e]
expressions differently and use a @racket[map/e] to build the actual list:
@racketblock[(map/e
              (λ (x) (list (caar x) (cadr x) (cdar x) (cddr x)))
              (λ (l) (cons (cons (list-ref l 0) (list-ref l 1))
                           (cons (list-ref l 4) (list-ref l 3))))
              (cons/e
               (cons/e nat/e nat/e)
               (cons/e nat/e nat/e)))]
then the billionth element is
@code{@(format "~v"
             (decode 
              (map/e
               (λ (x) (list (caar x) (cadr x) (cdar x) (cddr x)))
               (λ (l) (cons (cons (list-ref l 0) (list-ref l 1))
                            (cons (list-ref l 4) (list-ref l 3))))
               (cons/e
                (cons/e nat/e nat/e)
                (cons/e nat/e nat/e)))
              1000000000))}, 
which is much more balanced.

@;{TODO: cite Wolfram Conference Elegant Pairing Function}

@;{TODO: insert math formulae}
@;{TODO: talk about finite vs infinite}

The combinatorically-inclined reader may have noticed in our
description of @racket[cons/e] that we did not use the classic Cantor
pairing function for our bijection, which can be interpreted as a more
triangular grid walk:@centered{@cantor-cons-pict[]}

Instead we used another simple bijection that we refer to as "boxy"
pairing, and called an "Elegant" pairing function in TODO CITATION
NEEDED. The two bijections are quite similar, they are both quadratic
functions with similar geometric interpretations: boxy traces out the
edges of increasingly large squares and Cantor traces out the bottoms
of increasingly large triangles. This point of view leads to obvious
generalizations to n-tuples. Generalized boxy should trace out the
outer faces of an n cube and generalized Cantor should trace out the
outer face of an n simplex.

Despite their conceptual similarity, we found the boxy enumeration
lends itself to a more efficient implementation. To understand why, note
that most combinatorics applications of pairing functions are chiefly
concerned with one half of the bijection: the one from pairs of
natural numbers to natural numbers.
@;{TODO: see if I can make this prettier...}
@centered{@raw-latex{$cantor\_pair(m, n) = \frac{(n+m)(n+m+1)}{2} + m$}}
@centered{@raw-latex{$box\_pair(m, n) = \begin{cases} x^2+x+y &\mbox{if } x\ge y\\ x+y^2   &\mbox{if } x < y \end{cases}$}}

@;{Hilbert's 10th problem reference really necessary?}

whereas for enumerations we are primarily concerned with the other
half of the bijection, since that is the one used to generate
terms. For the pairing case, these functions have fairly
straightforward inverses, but their generalizations do not. This is
the generalization of the cantor pairing function to length
@raw-latex{$k$} tuples:
@centered{@raw-latex{$cantor\_tuple(n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_k) =
{{k-1+n_1+\cdots+n_k}\choose{n}}+\cdots+{{1+n_1+n_2}\choose{2}} +
{{n_1}\choose{1}}$}} This means to be able to invert such equations is
to solve a certain class of arbitrary degree diophantine
equations. While the solution to Hilbert's $10\textsuperscript{th}$
problem is that Diophantine equations are not generally solvable, we
can easily define a highly inefficient (but correct) way to compute
the inverse by trying every natural number, in order, applying the
original @raw-latex{$cantor\_tuple$} function to see if it was the
argument given. In @cite{interting-cantor-n-tupling}, they improve on
this implementation, but the algorithm there is still a search
procedure, and we found it too slow to use in practice.

So how do we generalize boxy pairing to boxy tupling and how do we
compute an efficient inverse? A geometric interpretation gives the
answer. If we look back at the grid-walk describing @racket[cons/e] a
pattern emerges, as the input indices grow, we trace out increasingly
large squares. For example, when we encode @racket[42] with
@racket[cons/e], we first take the square root with remainder, giving
us a root of @racket[6] with a remainder of @racket[8]. This tells us
that the larger value in the pair is @racket[6], and it's the
@racket[8]th such pair. Then we construct an enumeration of pairs
whose larger value is @racket[6], and index into that enumeration with
@racket[8], giving us the pair @racket['(6 . 0)]. Then we can easily
get the inverse transform by taking that pair, taking the maximum of
@racket[6] and @racket[0] to get @racket[6], and then we use the other
half of the enumeration of pairs above to find where in the
enumeration of pairs with larger value @racket[6] this @racket['(6
. 0)] is, and we find it is the @racket[8]th such pair. Then we square
@racket[6] to get @racket[36] and finally add @racket[8] to get our
original value of @racket[42].

The key takeaway is that we find what "layer" a value is on and we
bootstrap the implementation with existing implementations of
@racket[cons/e] and @racket[disj-sum/e] for finite enumerations,
giving us both halves of the layer enumeration in one fell
swoop. Fortunately, unlike the Cantor pairing function, this is
naturally generalized to an @raw-latex{$n$}-tupling function, by using
the @raw-latex{$n$}th root and @raw-latex{$n$}th power intead of the
square root and squaring. Otherwise the description is the same.

@;{TODO: Consider putting before Fair Pairing}
@section{Fair Union}
The @racket{disj-sum/e}'s ...
The @racket[disj-sum/e] enumerator also has to be fair and
to account for finite enumerations. So this
enumeration:
@racketblock[(disj-sum/e (cons (fin/e 'a 'b 'c 'd) symbol?)
                         (cons nat/e number?)
                         (cons (fin/e "x" "y") string?))]
has to cycle through the finite enumerations until they
are exhausted before producing the rest of the natural
numbers:
@enum-example[(disj-sum/e (cons (fin/e 'a 'b 'c 'd) symbol?)
                          (cons nat/e number?)
                          (cons (fin/e "x" "y") string?))
              14]
In general, this means that @racket[disj-sum/e] must track the
ranges of natural numbers when each finite enumeration is exhausted
to compute which enumeration to use for a given index.
