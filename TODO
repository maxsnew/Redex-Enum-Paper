DONE rewrite introduction [robby]
DONE move comments on specific papers from intro into related work (and
perhaps shrink them up a bit). [robby]
- make edits suggested by "small comments" sections of OOPSLA reviews  [jay?]
- add a new section between the current 2 and 3 that discusses
fairness and the euler/boxy pairing function (edit 2 to match that new
one) [max]
- re-run the benchmarks [burke]
- maybe discuss other applications (games)
- add to the related work with that Scala enumeration paper.
- look into whether to change emphasis to enum vs redex benchmark [robby]
