1. Model extension for trinary combinators  (Max)
2. writeup of bounded-list/e                (Max)
3. redex ambiguity                          (Robby)
4. write the dang paper                     (Max + everyone)
5. port coq model back to redex             (Robby)
6. automated testing of coq = redex = data/enumerate (Max + Robby)

- figure out what to do with this cite:

@inproceedings{ppdp14tarau,
        Address = {New York, NY, USA},
        Author = {Tarau, Paul},
        Booktitle = {{PPDP '14: Proceedings of the 16th international ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and Practice of Declarative Programming}},
        Location = {Canterburry, U.K.},
        Publisher = {ACM},
        Title = {{ Bijective Collection Encodings and Boolean Operations with Hereditarily Binary Natural Numbers}},
        Year = {2014}}

- figure out what to do with fairness for dep/e. Viable options seem to be:

  1. say nothing

  2.  explain how to make what appears to be fair enumeration of lists.
      => explain no proofs
      => explain it is sloooow
      => back things up with graphs
      => explain that we don't yet use this technique in Redex
