  Re: Reviewer C
  
We think the reviewer is not judging the contributions of the paper
within its intended domain. As we acknowledge in the paper, fair
enumerations are not the "best" for all testing systems, however the
context of the system is to be a lightweight, automatically-derived
system accessible to a user with little to no experience with random
testing. Since the system doesn't have specific domain knowledge, fair
enumerators are a "best-effort" that ensure that the generator is not
biased in ways bad for testing. A more experienced user can then use
the enumeration system as a library for constructing enumerators that
are biased towards generating more useful inputs.
