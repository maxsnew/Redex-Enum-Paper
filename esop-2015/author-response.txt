  Re: Reviewer A

After reading your review and reflecting on it, we completely agree
that the clarifying power of a formal semantics would be a huge help
to readers. We plan to include one in future versions of this paper
(and indeed have already started working on it). Explaining the
translation to Redex more carefully is similarly important and we plan
to improve that too.

  Re: Reviewer C

You seem to be asking us to work on a different problem that the one
we chose to work on. The system is intended to be lightweight, giving
a user a useful generator with no extra generation-specific
input. Since the system doesn't have specific domain knowledge, fair
enumerators are a "best-effort" that ensure that the generator is not
biased in ways bad for testing. A more experienced user can then use
the enumeration system as a library for constructing generators that
are biased towards generating more useful inputs.

Meanwhile, you seem to have made a technical error in your comments.
The "in-order" and "uniform random" are both using the enumeration
system and the fact that "a combination of in order and ad hoc
outperforms the fair technique in all cases" is to be expected since
it combines our technique with a complementary one.

  Re: Reviewer D

To your QUESTION, yes, that is the claim.

We thank reviewers B and D for the papers provided, and we agree that
they might be useful in extensions of our work.
