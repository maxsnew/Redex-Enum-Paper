  Re: Reviewer A
  
We appreciate the feedback on the formal semantics of the system, and
we think this problem can be easily rectified in the final version of
the paper.

The comments on the translation of redex models to enumerations are
also valid, and could also be easily added to section 4.

  Re: Reviewer C

We think the reviewer is not judging the contributions of the paper
within its intended domain. As we acknowledge in the paper, fair
enumerations are not the "best" for all testing systems, however the
context of the system is to be a lightweight, automatically-derived
test generator accessible to a user with little to no experience with
random testing. Since the system doesn't have specific domain
knowledge, fair enumerators are a "best-effort" that ensure that the
generator is not biased in ways bad for testing. A more experienced
user can then use the enumeration system as a library for constructing
generators that are biased towards generating more useful inputs.

We are also concerned that the reviewer misinterpreted the evaluation
section.  Just in case, we'd like to clarify that the "in-order" and
"uniform random" are both using the enumeration system and the fact
that "a combination of in order and ad hoc outperforms the fair
technique in all cases" is to be expected sense it combines our
technique with a complementary one.
