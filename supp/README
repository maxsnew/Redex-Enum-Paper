Supplementary Material

The coq development is in `model/Enum.v`. `make admit` builds the
model and checks to make sure there are no admitted proofs. We have
tested with coqc version "8.4pl5".

The model used for typesetting in the paper is in `model/model.rkt`.
The file `run-coq-redex-tests.rkt` tests the coq model, the
typesetting model and the actual racket implementation for agreement.

Racket version 6.2 is needed to run the racket code. It is available
from http://www.racket-lang.org/
