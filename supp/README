The coq development is in `model/Enum.v`. `make admit` builds the
model and checks to make sure there are no admitted proofs. We have
tested with coqc version "8.4pl5".

The model used for typesetting in the paper is in `model/model.rkt`.
The file `run-coq-redex-tests.rkt` tests the coq model, the
typesetting model and the actual racket implementation for agreement.

A racket snapshot build will be needed to run the racket code.  For
Linux and Mac OS X users it should be easy to install from source by
cloning https://github.com/plt/racket and `make` in that directory.
Premade builds are available at http://pre.racket-lang.org/installers/
and this will likely be the easiest method for Windows users.
