@title{Pairing and Tupling}

The combinatorially-inclined reader may have noticed in our
description of @racket[cons/e] that we did not use the classic Cantor
pairing function for our bijection, which can be interpreted as a more
triangular grid walk:@centered{@cantor-cons-pict[]}. Instead we use
@citet[elegant-pairing-function]'s bijection, that we refer to as
``boxy'' pairing, which is specified in the "cons/e x" and "cons/e y"
rules in @Figure-ref["fig:semantics"].

The two bijections are quite similar; they are both quadratic
functions with similar geometric interpretations: boxy traces out the
edges of increasingly large squares and Cantor traces out the bottoms
of increasingly large triangles. This is exactly why they are both
fair. When enumerating, each ``layer'' uses its arguments equally so
enumerating each layer in turn is fair.

The geometric point of view also leads to natural generalizations to
n-tuples. Generalized boxy should trace out the outer faces of an n
cube and generalized Cantor should trace out the outer face of an n
simplex. It

Despite their conceptual similarity, we found the boxy enumeration
lends itself to a more efficient implementation. To understand why, note
that most combinatorics applications of pairing functions are chiefly
concerned with one half of the bijection: the one from pairs of
natural numbers to natural numbers.
@centered{@raw-latex{$cantor\_pair(m, n) = \frac{(n+m)(n+m+1)}{2} + m$}}
@centered{@raw-latex{$box\_pair(m, n) = \begin{cases} x^2+x+y &\mbox{if } x\ge y\\ x+y^2   &\mbox{if } x < y \end{cases}$}}

For enumerations we are primarily concerned with the other
direction of the bijection, since that is the one used to generate
terms. For the pairing case, these functions have fairly
straightforward inverses, but their generalizations do not. This is
the generalization of the cantor pairing function to length
@texmath{k} tuples:
@centered{@raw-latex{$cantor\_tuple(n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_k) =
{{k-1+n_1+\cdots+n_k}\choose{n}}+\cdots+{{1+n_1+n_2}\choose{2}} +
{{n_1}\choose{1}}$}}
We can easily define a highly inefficient (but correct) way to compute
the inverse by trying every natural number, in order, applying the
original @raw-latex{$cantor\_tuple$} function to see if it was the
argument given. The best known algorithm for this
@citet[inverting-cantor-n-tupling] improves on this implementation by
vastly reducing the search space, but the algorithm there is still a
search procedure, and we found it too slow to use in practice.

So how do we generalize boxy pairing to boxy tupling and how do we
compute an efficient inverse? A geometric interpretation gives the
answer. If we look back at the grid-walk describing @racket[cons/e] a
pattern emerges, as the input indices grow, we trace out increasingly
large squares. For example, when we encode @racket[42] with
@racket[cons/e], we first take the square root with remainder, giving
us a root of @racket[6] with a remainder of @racket[8]. This tells us
that the larger value in the pair is @racket[6], and it's the
@racket[8]th such pair. Then we construct an enumeration of pairs
whose larger value is @racket[6], and index into that enumeration with
@racket[8], giving us the pair @racket['(6 . 0)]. Then we can easily
get the inverse transform by taking that pair, taking the maximum of
@racket[6] and @racket[0] to get @racket[6], and then we use the other
half of the enumeration of pairs above to find where in the
enumeration of pairs with larger value @racket[6] this @racket['(6
. 0)] is, and we find it is the @racket[8]th such pair. Then we square
@racket[6] to get @racket[36] and finally add @racket[8] to get our
original value of @racket[42].

The key idea is that we find what ``layer'' a value is on and we
bootstrap the implementation with existing implementations of
@racket[cons/e] and @racket[disj-sum/e] for finite enumerations,
giving us both halves of the layer enumeration in one fell
swoop. Fortunately, unlike the Cantor pairing function, this is
naturally generalized to an @raw-latex{$n$}-tupling function, by using
the @raw-latex{$n$}th root and @raw-latex{$n$}th power intead of the
square root and squaring. Otherwise the description is the same.

@; how much glory do we need below?
@racketblock[(define (box-untuple k)
               (Î» (n)
                 (define layer (integer-root n k)) ; floor of the kth root of n
                 (define smallest (expt layer k))  ; layer^k
                 (define layer/e (bounded-list/e k layer))
                 (decode layer/e (- n smallest))))]
                 
Here @racket[bounded-list/e] is a function that takes a positive
integer list length @racket[k] and a natural number bound
@racket[layer] and returns an enumeration of lists of length
@racket[k] that have a maximal value of @racket[layer]. For example the values of @racket[(bounded-list/e 3 2)] are

@enum-example[(slice/e (list/e natural/e natural/e natural/e) 8 10000000000) 19]

Since the elements of the enumerated lists are bounded by a specific
number, @racket[bounded-list/e] always returns a finite enumeration,
which we denote @racket[e]. Furthermore, enumerating every element of
@racket[e] will use all of its arguments in exactly the same way since
for any tuple @racket[(i_1 i_2 ... i_k)] in @racket[e], every
permutation of that tuple is also in @racket[e], since it has the same
maximum.

@;{TODO: prime factorized list/e is fair?}
