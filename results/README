all/ contains the combined logs, with log lines for gc and heartbeats
removed. Also rb-trees-3-enum from the fair run is left out, beacause it
contains a timeout event that logged a single GIGANTIC counterexample
that causes the plot script to choke.

(Look in fair-24/rbtrees-3-enum.rktd to see the huge timeout.)

The other subdirectories contain the full outputs from the 24 hour runs
